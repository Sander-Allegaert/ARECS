Master Thesis Sander Allegaert: Automated Rate Equation Construction and Screening for heterogeneous catalytic reactions based on experimental converison data

Put all of the scripts into one folder (FeatureExtraction, ARECS_Tool, ARECS_RunningScript).
Add the 'Input' directory into this folder and put input excel files into this directory. An example input excel file is uploaded in this folder.
To run the tool, run ARECS_RunningScript. Because this tool is still in development, certain things must be typed directly into the script (e.g. 'Species_total', 'Overall_stoich', 'Conv_species', 'Reactor_type', 'Known_ads', 'Known_Values')
